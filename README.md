# OpenIPF Visualizations
Visualising progress from comp data. This has been done based on openIPF outputs. Work in progress, trying to make nice graphs and provide them in an accessible way. Potential names: openpowerliftWing or slightly_ajar_powerlifting, but for now its openIPF visualizations.

Features: 
- Shows data for full power or bench only comps, equipped or raw.
- Provides interactive graphs with extra data in the hovereover
- Double click on lines within the key to isolate certain data series
- Export graphs by clicking camera icon

## Guide
This is optimised for openIPF data as I wasn't sure if other federations enter their data differently. If you try this let me know.

Otherwise, download the data from your profile on https://www.openpowerlifting.org/ or https://www.openipf.org/

Go to https://wskoon.github.io/? and apply the relevant filters. If you want to change the filters you need to refresh/resubmit.

Et voila, have fun!

## Contact
Message me @powerliftwing on instagram for feedback/bug reporting. There are a few issues I know I need to fix such as how it handles failed attempts if you failed first or second attempts.
